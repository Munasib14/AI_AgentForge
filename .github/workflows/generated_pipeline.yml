# Transformed Infra
I'm ready to help. However, you haven't provided the Jenkins pipeline script. Please provide the script, and I'll convert it into a GitHub Actions workflow YAML file. 

Once you provide the script, I'll get started!

# -- Refactoring Suggestions --
# Keep secrets and sensitive data in environment variables or secrets manager.

// -- Jenkins Pipeline Optimization Suggestions --
// - Include a 'post' section for better visibility into pipeline success or failure.
// - Use parameters to make the pipeline reusable for different environments or builds.

# -- Deployment Strategy Recommendations --
# CI/CD Tip: Automate your deployment process with stages like Build, Test, and Deploy. Use proper error handling and post-build actions to ensure stability.
