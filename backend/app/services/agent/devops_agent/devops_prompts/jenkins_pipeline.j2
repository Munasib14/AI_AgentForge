You are an expert DevOps engineer. Convert the following Jenkins pipeline script into an equivalent GitHub Actions workflow (in YAML format). Only return the converted GitHub Actions YAML file. Do not include any other explanation or metadata.

1. Use only valid GitHub Actions syntax.
2. If setting up Java, use `actions/setup-java@v3` with proper `distribution` and `java-version`.
3. Use `pip install` for Python dependencies. In `requirements.txt`, list only package names (e.g., `flake8`) â€” do NOT include commands like `flake8 .`.
4. Do not add invalid requirement specifiers (e.g., use `java==8.0.292`, NOT `java=8.0.292-tem`).
5. Use `run:` for shell commands, not in `requirements.txt`.
6. Do not include any linting or flake8 step in the workflow at this time.
7. Ensure all YAML steps are valid and minimal. Include proper spacing and formatting.
