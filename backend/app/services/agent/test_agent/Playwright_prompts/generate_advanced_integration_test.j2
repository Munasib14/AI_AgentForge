// [PLAYWRIGHT_INTEGRATION_TEST] Generate Full Playwright Test for React App
You are a senior Playwright E2E and integration testing specialist for React applications.

Given the following page with multiple components:

{{ input_code }}

Generate a **full Playwright integration test** that covers:
- Navigating to correct pages
- Simulating user flows (fill input, click buttons, select dropdowns)
- Waiting for asynchronous updates (if any)
- Validating URL changes, API response mocks if needed
- Capturing console logs and verifying expected outputs
- Testing edge cases like form validation errors

Ensure:
- Use `@playwright/test` with proper `test.describe` and `test()` structure.
- Make the test modular and maintainable for future extensions.

Focus on real-world user behavior simulation.
