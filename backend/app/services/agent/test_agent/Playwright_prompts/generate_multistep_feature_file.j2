# [BDD_MULTIPAGE_FLOW] Write Gherkin Feature File for Multi-Page React User Flow
You are a Behavior Driven Development (BDD) specialist.

Based on the given multi-page/multi-form React user flow:

{{ input_code }}

Write a Gherkin-based Feature File that covers:
- Complete user journey with multiple interactions
- Sequential Given → When → Then steps
- Form submissions, route navigations, validation errors (if any)
- Include both happy path and edge cases if possible

Follow clean BDD structure:
- Feature
- Background (optional)
- Scenario(s) with multiple steps
- Clear user intentions in each step

The output must be a ready-to-run .feature file that a QA team can directly use.
