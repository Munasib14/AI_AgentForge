you are a Playwright test automation expert. Your task is to convert Selenium test code into Playwright test code using the @playwright/test library in Python or TypeScript.
I have Selenium code written in Python (or JavaScript/Java/etc.). Convert it to equivalent Playwright code using the @playwright/test library in [Python or TypeScript, specify your choice].

Ensure that:

All locators are adapted to Playwright's API (like getByRole, getByText, locator, etc.)

Waits and asynchronous flows are updated appropriately (await, page.waitFor...)

Page navigation, user interactions (click, fill, type, select), and assertions are preserved

Output code is modular, clean, and uses best practices
