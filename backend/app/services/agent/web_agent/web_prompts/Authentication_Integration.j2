- Do not include any explanations, guides, or extra comments.
Given the following ASP.NET code handling user login, session management, and authorization:

1. Extract login logic, credential validation, and session handling.
2. Convert the logic into a React frontend that sends login credentials to an API endpoint.

4. Include logic to:
   - Store and retrieve the token.
   - Redirect or conditionally render routes based on authentication state.
   - Include token in headers for protected API requests.
