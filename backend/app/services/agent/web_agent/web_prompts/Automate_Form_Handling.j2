- Only output the converted .
- Do not include any explanations, guides, or extra comments.
Given the following ASP.NET code, extract all form fields, their types, labels, validation rules (like required, regex, range, etc.), and then generate:

1. A React functional component with a form using React Hook Form.
2. Form inputs mapped to appropriate HTML5 types.
3. Validation logic using React Hook Form's validation schema.
4. Clean layout with semantic HTML and TailwindCSS (if used).
5. A submit handler that logs or sends the form data.
